---Cover letter------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my last experience at Rise Interactive, I had the opportunity to grow my career, going from a Senior Test Engineer to the Delivery Manager in only 7.5 years, 
where I managed 2 teams of 15 Engineers each. During this time, I was able to completely transform the Innovation Department Engineering team processes and practices, 
increasing the value of the product we build and the business we serve: I designed and implemented all the QA practices, improved the daily work processes by 
training the Engineers in Agile SCRUM Framework, drive the successful completion of development projects for a SaaS product, collaborating with cross-functional 
teams, product teams, marketing consultants, and C-level stakeholders, being accountable for creating delivery plans and keeping the progress tracked, while 
anticipating risks (issues or opportunities) and appropriately addressing them, minimizing the Roadmap's impact.

-----What I have to offer---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a seasoned manager with extensive experience in Software Quality Assurance, I offer a proven ability to drive the successful development and delivery of 
high-quality products that provide significant business value. I excel at building and mentoring high-performing teams, implementing Agile best practices to optimize 
development processes, and proactively identifying and mitigating risks to ensure on-time, on-budget project completion. I’m sure I can help your engineers to reach 
their full potential while consistently exceeding expectations for product quality and delivery.

-----Initiatives------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As Delivery Manager, many of the processes introduced to the team and daily work were part of my definition and ideation:
● Designed a tool that helps with follow-up on risks, keeps daily work, issues, and blockers tracked, and measures impact and project goals deviation.
● Designed multiple dashboards to provide visibility of the teamwork and project progress for all stakeholders.
● Set up and configure Jira projects to organize project artifacts in epics, stories, and subtasks.
● Designed an Agile Scrum training for the entire Engineering team.
● Implemented Atlassian Jira tools to create Delivery Plans and successfully allocate tasks according to the team effort, capacity, and velocity.

-----A challenge-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before I was promoted to Project Manager, the Engineering team struggled to deliver on time and often fell short of their committed goals for 8 consecutive Sprints, and 
the project delivery date was changed at least 3 times, damaging the stakeholders and the business's confidence in this team. During my time there, I was able to help 
them by completely transforming the processes and practices while increasing the value of the product we build and the business we serve: improved the daily work of the 
cross-funtional team by promoting collaboration practices, trained the Engineers in Agiles SCRUM Framework and encourage them to embrace its practices to elevate the quality 
of our deliverables. All this resulted, in the short term, in a restructuring of the team and a firm commitment delivery date that the team was able to accomplish. In the long 
term, it resulted in a 40% reduction of inconsistencies or issues found during the development and post-development stages, and a 60% improvement in delivery times and task 
estimation.

-----Agile-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've worked with the Agile Scrum Framework for over 11 years. In my last experience, the Scrum Master, who reports to me, and I share the responsibility of leading all the 
Scrum ceremonies, practices, documenting processes, and training the team, for which I created a guide and a deck to conduct training sessions for all the Engineers.

-----Conflict management-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I lead 2 teams with 15 people each. I handle conflict with clear and accurate communication, hearing all the parts involved in the conflict, and trying to mediate while 
taking care of the project trade-offs and impact by applying quick and solid solutions to the problems with a minimum impact on the work in progress.

-----Risk management---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One common Risk I have identified is the unclear definition of requirements while reviewing technical approaches with the Engineers during Discovery or Refinement sessions. 
I immediately addressed the concerns by creating discussion spaces with Product people and Developers to clarify the missing concept/information and, if required, create tasks 
to update the related documentation and follow up on the Refinement session so that all the concerns are solved and the team has a solid plan.

-----Communication management-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In my 13+ years of experience, I worked only with International teams (US, Mexico, France, UK, Spain, India), always speaking in English (my native language is Spanish), so I feel 
comfortable with that. I can handle the clients' expectations by having clear, simple, and continuous communication with them, keeping every oral communication tracked and written 
so everybody is on the same page.

============================================================================================================
I am eager to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to your team's success.
